The Federal Board of Revenue FBR of Pakistan is responsible for overseeing the countrys tax administration, and its offices are strategically located across various regions. These offices include Chief Commissioners, Director Generals, and other heads of departments, each overseeing distinct areas of taxation and customs enforcement. The Chief Commissioner offices are found in major cities like Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar, with specific duties to address both large and medium taxpayers as well as corporate tax concerns. Each of these offices is equipped with dedicated teams and resources to ensure efficient tax collection, audit management, and taxpayer services. Among the many offices under the FBR, the Regional Tax Offices RTOs handle operations that range from general taxation to specific focus on customs and excise duties. These offices are located in key cities such as Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sukkur, Sialkot, and Quetta, providing localized services tailored to the needs of taxpayers in these regions. The Large Taxpayers Offices LTOs located in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore cater specifically to high-value taxpayers, ensuring that large corporations comply with their tax obligations and that any concerns regarding their returns are effectively addressed.

In addition to the RTOs and LTOs, the Directorate Generals play a crucial role in enhancing the FBRs operations. They focus on specialized areas like training and research, customs valuation, intelligence and investigation, internal audit, and post-clearance audits. These directorates are spread across various cities including Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, with each one ensuring specific aspects of tax and customs enforcement are meticulously managed. Directorates of Internal Audit are particularly important for maintaining transparency and accountability within the organization, conducting audits to prevent fraud, mismanagement, and inefficiencies. The Ministry of Railways, also a key player in Pakistans infrastructure development, operates with its own dedicated network of departments. From overseeing railway projects to managing procurement and resource allocation, the Ministry plays a vital role in modernizing the countrys rail system. The department manages major projects like the ML1 project in collaboration with China and Dubai, focusing on upgrading the rail infrastructure. The Ministrys communication platforms, such as their official website and social media accounts, keep citizens informed about the latest developments, including project statuses, job openings, and investment opportunities. The Ministry's efforts also extend to ensuring the welfare of its employees and maintaining high standards in service delivery, ensuring that Pakistan's railways continue to serve as a backbone of the nation's transport network.

Ministry of Railways is proactive in managing its own internal systems, including an extensive digital platform for job applications, tender notices, and forms for pension disbursement, highlighting its commitment to modernization. This digital approach reflects the government’s broader vision to streamline public services and foster transparency across its sectors, including both the FBR and Ministry of Railways. Furthermore, initiatives like the Public-Private Partnerships PPP projects are central to attracting investment, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and profitability of Pakistans railway network, while also contributing to broader economic development goals. All of these offices, directorates, and ministries serve the larger purpose of strengthening Pakistan’s economic structure by enhancing tax collection, improving governance, and modernizing infrastructure. With robust oversight and continuous efforts to streamline processes, these entities contribute to the financial stability and growth of the nation, ensuring that public services are delivered efficiently and that international partnerships can be leveraged for long-term development.


The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives of Pakistan plays a crucial role in the country’s overall economic and infrastructural development. This Ministry is dedicated to formulating and implementing policies aimed at fostering sustainable development and improving the socio-economic conditions of the population. It oversees various initiatives like the uplift of the poorest districts, gender equality programs, and national economic planning, including key projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC. Among its primary functions are coordinating development efforts across ministries and divisions, managing public sector development projects, and ensuring that federal policies align with the broader goals of economic growth and poverty reduction.

Ministry  has a wide-ranging impact through its active engagement with the private sector, international organizations, and local governments. Its work covers not only long-term projects but also technical and economic matters essential for the countrys development, such as the Pakistan Innovation Fund and the 5E Framework, which addresses educational reforms. The Ministry offers resources like the Planning and Development Digital Library, newsletters, and downloadable publications that keep the public and stakeholders informed about policy developments, tenders, and progress reports. It also maintains a variety of training and capacity-building initiatives to enhance the effectiveness of its programs and to support various sectors in implementing development goals.

In line with its responsibilities, the Ministry also focuses on improving internal systems through technology and innovation. One example is the Intelligent Project Automation System, which monitors project progress and ensures transparency in the Public Sector Development Program PSDP. Through the PSDP portal, citizens can track government development efforts and access detailed data on ongoing and completed projects. Moreover, initiatives like the National Job Portal facilitate recruitment and employment, connecting the public with government job opportunities. These efforts aim to build a more responsive and efficient public sector that serves the needs of the nation while promoting accountability.

The Ministry addresses issues related to employees welfare, including the management of pension systems and providing resources for civil servants. With a special focus on the economic and social well-being of Pakistani citizens, the Ministrys actions are integral to the countrys development trajectory. By supporting initiatives that enhance governance, education, gender equality, and infrastructure, the Ministry plays a key role in shaping the future of Pakistan’s socio economic landscape. Additionally, the Ministrys work in policy-making and its participation in international development agreements, including SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), reflects its commitment to global development frameworks and sustainable growth for the future.

The Federal Board of Revenue FBR of Pakistan, as part of the governments revenue collection framework, has its own set of regulations and acts designed to streamline tax administration and enforcement. The FBR is responsible for implementing tax laws, including the Sales Tax Act of 1990, the Income Tax Ordinance of 2001, and the Customs Act of 1969, along with a series of amendments to these laws. These amendments, along with various tax-related ordinances and regulations, are critical in managing the countrys tax structure and ensuring that taxes are levied fairly and efficiently. The FBR also engages in anti-money laundering efforts, combating terrorism financing, and implementing Benami Transactions Prohibition Acts, all of which support the integrity of the nation’s financial systems.

The FBRs regulations extend to managing tax collection, appeals, and enforcement procedures, including specific rules governing the income tax, sales tax, and excise tax. In its effort to foster transparency, the FBR uses digital platforms to provide updates on tax laws, recruitment opportunities, and job postings, ensuring that the public remains informed and involved. The Ministry also handles the implementation of the Pakistan Single Window system, which integrates various trade data dissemination and risk management systems for more efficient customs clearance and business operations. These reforms are integral to modernizing the tax administration system in Pakistan, enhancing its capacity to monitor, collect, and manage revenues while adhering to international standards of governance.

Through its robust regulatory framework, the FBR ensures that both individuals and organizations comply with their tax obligations. The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives, in cooperation with the FBR, also facilitates the implementation of policies and reforms aimed at reducing tax evasion and improving the ease of doing business. The collective efforts of these bodies aim at achieving long-term economic stability, enhancing public sector efficiency, and fostering an environment conducive to investment and development.

Legal Framework SBP s Functions are mainly governed by SBP Act 1956 as amended up to 28 01 2022 Banking Companies Ordinance 196 2 Foreign Exchange Regulations Act 1947 Payment System and Electronic Fund Transfer Act 2007 Under the State Bank of Pakistan Order 1948 the Bank was charged with the duty to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in Pakistan and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage The scope of the Bank s operations was considerably widened in the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 which required the Bank to regulate the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and to foster its growth in the best national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilisation of the country s productive resources Under financial sector reforms the State Bank of Pakistan was granted autonomy in February 1994 On 21st January 1997 this autonomy was further strengthened by issuing three Amendment Ordinances which were approved by the Parliament in May 1997 namely State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 and Banks Nationalisation Act 1974 The changes in the State Bank Act gave full and exclusive authority to the State Bank to regulate the banking sector to conduct an independent monetary policy and to set limit on government borrowings from the State Bank of Pakistan The amendments in Banks Nationalisation Act abolished the Pakistan Banking Council an institution established to look after the affairs of NCBs and institutionalised the process of appointment of the Chief Executives and Boards of the nationalised commercial banks NCBs and development finance institutions DFIs with the Sate Bank having a role in their appointment and removal The amendments also increased the autonomy and accountability of the Chief Executives and the Boards of Directors of banks and DFIs


Functions of SBP Like a Central Bank in any developing country State Bank of Pakistan performs both the traditional and developmental functions to achieve macro economic goals The traditional functions which are generally performed by central banks almost all over the world may be classified into two groups a the primary functions including issue of notes regulation and supervision of the financial system bankers bank lender of the last resort banker to Government and conduct of monetary policy and b the secondary functions including the agency functions like management of public debt management of foreign exchange etc and other functions like advising the government on policy matters and maintaining close relationships with international financial institutions The non traditional or promotional functions performed by the State Bank include development of financial framework institutionalisation of savings and investment provision of training facilities to bankers and provision of credit to priority sectors The State Bank also has been playing an active part in the process of islamization of the banking system The main functions and responsibilities of the State Bank can be broadly categorised as under REGULATION OF LIQUIDITY Being the Central Bank of the country State Bank of Pakistan has been entrusted with the responsibility to formulate and conduct monetary and credit policy in a manner consistent with the Government s targets for growth and inflation and the recommendations of the Monetary and Fiscal Policies Co ordination Board with respect to macro economic policy objectives The basic objective underlying its functions is two fold i e the maintenance of monetary stability thereby leading towards the stability in the domestic prices as well as the promotion of economic growth To regulate the volume and the direction of flow of credit to different uses and sectors the Bank makes use of both direct and indirect instruments of monetary management Until recently the monetary and credit scenario was characterised by acute segmentation of credit markets with all the attendant distortions Pakistan embarked upon a program of financial sector reforms in the late 1980s A number of fundamental changes have since been made in the conduct of monetary management which essentially marked a departure from administrative controls and quantitative restrictions to market based monetary management A reserve money management programme has been developed In terms of the programme the intermediate target of M2 would be achieved by observing the desired path of reserve money the operating target While use in now being made of such indirect instruments of control as cash reserve ratio and liquidity ratio the program s reliance is mainly on open market operations ENSURING THE SOUNDNESS OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM REGULATION AND SUPERVISION One of the fundamental responsibilities of the State Bank is regulation and supervision of the financial system to ensure its soundness and stability as well as to protect the interests of depositors The rapid advancement in information technology together with growing complexities of modern banking operations has made the supervisory role more challenging The institutional complexity is increasing technical sophistication is improving and technical base of banking activities is expanding All this requires the State Bank to endeavor to keep pace with the fast changing financial landscape of the country As a response to these challenges and considering the international best practices SBP has adopted a Risk Based Supervisory approach The Banking Supervision Department 1 Banking Supervision Department 2 and Banking Supervision Department 3 conduct supervisory activities through supervisory teams which encompass off site supervision on site assessments and enforcement actions The intensity of supervisory activities commensurate with the risk profile of supervised institutions For detailed Supervisory Regime click here EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS One of the major responsibilities of the State Bank is the maintenance of external value of the currency In this regard the Bank is required among other measures taken by it to regulate foreign exchange reserves of the country in line with the stipulations of the Foreign Exchange Act 1947 As an agent to the Government the Bank has been authorised to purchase and sale gold silver or approved foreign exchange and transactions of Special Drawing Rights with the International Monetary Fund under sub sections 13 a and 13 f of Section 17 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 The Bank is responsible to keep the exchange rate of the rupee at an appropriate level and prevent it from wide fluctuations in order to maintain competitiveness of our exports and maintain stability in the foreign exchange market To achieve the objective various exchange policies have been adopted from time to time keeping in view the prevailing circumstances Pak rupee remained linked to Pound Sterling till September 1971 and subsequently to U S Dollar However it was decided to adopt the managed floating exchange rate system w e f January 8 1982 under which the value of the rupee was determined on daily basis with reference to a basket of currencies of Pakistan s major trading partners and competitors Adjustments were made in its value as and when the circumstances so warranted During the course of time an important development took place when Pakistan accepted obligations of Article VIII Section 2 3 and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement thereby making the Pak rupee convertible for current international transactions with effect from July 1 1994 After nuclear detonation by Pakistan in 1998 a two tier exchange rate system was introduced w e f 22nd July 1998 with a view to reduce the pressure on official reserves and prevent the economy to some extent from adverse implications of sanctions imposed on Pakistan However effective 19th May 1999 the exchange rate has been unified with the introduction of market based floating exchange rate system under which the exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply positions in the foreign exchange market The surrender requirement of foreign exchange receipts on account of exports and services previously required to be made to State Bank through authorized dealers has now been done away with and the commercial banks and other authorised dealers have been made free to hold and undertake transaction in foreign currencies As the custodian of country s external reserves the State Bank is also responsible for the management of the foreign exchange reserves The task is being performed by an Investment Committee which after taking into consideration the overall level of reserves maturities and payment obligations takes decision to make investment of surplus funds in such a manner that ensures liquidity of funds as well as maximises the earnings These reserves are also being used for intervention in the foreign exchange market For this purpose a Foreign Exchange Dealing Room has been set up at the Central Directorate of State Bank of Pakistan and services of a Forex Expert have been acquired DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE OF STATE BANK The responsibility of a Central Bank in a developing country goes well beyond the regulatory duties of managing the monetary policy in order to achieve the macro economic goals This role covers not only the development of important components of monetary and capital markets but also to assist the process of economic growth and promote the fuller utilisation of a country s resources Ever since its establishment the State Bank of Pakistan besides discharging its traditional functions of regulating money and credit has played an active developmental role to promote the realisation of macro economic goals The explicit recognition of the promotional role of the Central Bank evidently stems from a desire to re orientate all policies towards the goal of rapid economic growth Accordingly the orthodox central banking functions have been combined by the State Bank with a well recognised developmental role The scope of Bank s operations has been widened considerably by including the economic growth objective in its statute under the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 The Bank s participation in the development process has been in the form of rehabilitation of banking system in Pakistan development of new financial institutions and debt instruments in order to promote financial intermediation establishment of Development Financial Institutions DFIs directing the use of credit according to selected development priorities providing subsidised credit and development of the capital market
